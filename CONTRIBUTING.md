# CONTRIBUTING

## Coding Style

Try to adopt to the currently used style. Examples:
  - Use 4 whitespaces for indentation.
  - Variables are in camelCase.
  - No hungarian notation.
  - Don't be afraid to ask nor to do PRs.

## Commits

Make it easy for me to understand your changes:
  - Shortly describe what you changed in your commit message.
  - Don't submit different changes in one commit. Each commit has one purpose.
  - Style fixes must not be combined with code changes.
  - Avoid merge conflicts. (Step1: Don't commit in master branch)
  - [Sign your commits.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)
  - Each pull request has its own branch -> easy to merge.
  - It would be nice if you test your code.
  - If you need some advice on how to do so, see below on how to contact me.

## ETC

Don't be afraid to commit or contact me. You can always contact me if you want me to review your changes (e.g. via git format-patch).
